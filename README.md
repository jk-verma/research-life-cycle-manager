# Research Lifecycle Manager

Research Lifecycle Manager is a GitHub Pages-friendly academic research lifecycle portal for a faculty supervisor. It is designed as a static React + Vite application using repository JSON files as the data source.

The app supports two working areas:

- Research Supervision for Masters, PhD, and interns
- Faculty Academic Workbench for publications, books, chapters, conference papers, projects, consultancy, MOOCs, and custom academic activities
- Daily Planner for teaching, research, supervision, projects, administration, external engagements, and custom work
- Deadline Calendar for submissions, revisions, follow-ups, project reports, meetings, milestones, teaching deliverables, consultancy, and MOOC milestones
- Teaching, Admin Work, External Engagements, Projects & Sponsored Work, Research, and Reports pages
- Academic Year views for past-year tracking and carry-forward work

## GitHub Pages Architecture

- App: React + Vite
- Hosting: GitHub Pages
- Routing: hash routing, for example `#/candidates`
- Data: static JSON files under `public/config` and `public/data`
- Deployment: GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- Runtime backend: none required for core functionality

The deployed site also includes a no-build static entrypoint so it still works when GitHub Pages is configured to serve `main` from the repository root. GitHub Actions deployment remains supported for normal Vite builds.

This version intentionally does not implement custom password login. GitHub Pages cannot securely enforce app-level password authentication by itself. Access is expected to be handled by repository/page visibility and trusted-user sharing.

## Static Role Model

Roles are logical UI modes loaded from `public/config/users.json` and `public/config/permissions.json`.

- `ADMIN`: full UI access, can archive records in local browser state, can manage visibility labels by editing config files
- `ASSISTANT`: can create entries, update permitted records, add daily logs, deadlines, follow-up notes, meeting details, attendees, and action items
- `WRITER`: can append notes and prepare exportable JSON changes, but deletion is disabled
- `VIEWER`: read-only mode
- `RESTRICTED_EXTERNAL`: sees only sanitized content

Writing rights in the static UI are available to `ADMIN`, `ASSISTANT`, and legacy `WRITER`. `VIEWER` and `RESTRICTED_EXTERNAL` do not receive local editor/export controls for prepared writing changes. Archive/correction/close controls remain admin-oriented.

These roles are not secure authentication. They are data and UI policies for a static trusted-user portal. The code is structured so these roles can later map to real backend auth.

The primary admin profile is Dr. Jitendra Kumar Verma. Assistant entries are tracked through `created_by`, `updated_by`, timestamps, and append-only history arrays.

## Data Files

Main files:

- `public/config/users.json`
- `public/config/permissions.json`
- `public/data/candidates/candidates.json`
- `public/data/meetings/meetings.json`
- `public/data/workbench/workbench.json`
- `public/data/daily-activities/daily-activities.json`
- `public/data/calendar/calendar.json`
- `public/data/academic-life/academic-life.json`

Records are Git-friendly and human-readable. Normal editing uses append-only arrays:

- `notes_append_only`
- `comments_append_only`
- `revision_history`

Normal UI flows never delete historical entries. Admin archive changes update status and append a revision entry.

## Academic Year Logic

All core records include:

- `academic_year_start`
- `academic_year_current`
- `carry_forward`
- `status`

Incomplete records with `carry_forward: true` appear in the Academic Years view without duplicating original history. Past academic year records remain editable through the static JSON workflow by appending history entries rather than deleting older data.

## Folder Structure

```text
src/
  components/     reusable HTML UI fragments
  data/           static JSON loader and validation
  hooks/          reserved for future React/Vite hooks
  pages/          dashboard, candidate, meeting, workbench, search, data, settings pages
  utils/          visibility, search, export, date, and HTML helpers
public/
  config/         role and permission JSON
  data/           candidate, meeting, and workbench JSON
.github/workflows/pages.yml
```

## Routes

Hash routes are GitHub Pages safe:

- `#/dashboard`
- `#/candidates`
- `#/candidates/<candidate_id>`
- `#/candidates/<candidate_id>/phase/<phase>`
- `#/meetings`
- `#/meetings/<meeting_id>`
- `#/workbench`
- `#/workbench/<module>`
- `#/workbench/<module>/<record_id>`
- `#/planner`
- `#/planner/<activity_id>`
- `#/research`
- `#/teaching`
- `#/teaching/<record_id>`
- `#/supervision`
- `#/projects`
- `#/admin-work`
- `#/admin-work/<record_id>`
- `#/external`
- `#/external/<record_id>`
- `#/reports`
- `#/activities`
- `#/activities/<activity_id>`
- `#/calendar`
- `#/calendar/<calendar_id>`
- `#/years`
- `#/years/<academic_year>`
- `#/search`
- `#/data`
- `#/settings`

## Confidentiality

Visibility levels:

- `admin_only`
- `supervisor_only`
- `internal`
- `candidate_visible`
- `sanitized_external`

Restricted external users see:

```text
Confidential content hidden
```

Masking happens in the React UI based on the selected logical role and visibility metadata.

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build production static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Editing JSON Data

For simple edits:

1. Open the relevant JSON file under `public/data` or `public/config`.
2. Add new records or append to `notes_append_only`, `comments_append_only`, or `revision_history`.
3. Commit and push changes to GitHub.

For UI-assisted edits:

1. Open the app.
2. Choose `ADMIN` or `WRITER` logical role.
3. Append notes from meeting or workbench detail pages, or prepare a structured draft on the Data page.
4. Preview the local draft and JSON diff-style summary.
5. Export a record-specific JSON draft or full JSON bundle.
6. Copy the changed sections into the repository JSON files.
7. Commit and push.

The browser cannot directly commit to GitHub Pages. This is intentional for low-maintenance static hosting.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The workflow `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and deploys the site from `main`.

Repository name expected by default:

```text
research-lifecycle-manager
```

Expected Pages URL:

```text
https://<username>.github.io/research-lifecycle-manager/
```

The workflow sets the Vite base path from the actual GitHub repository name:

```text
VITE_BASE_PATH=/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/
```

For local production builds, `vite.config.js` defaults to `/research-lifecycle-manager/`. If your repository name differs and you are building locally, set `VITE_BASE_PATH` before running `npm run build`.

In GitHub:

1. Open repository Settings.
2. Go to Pages.
3. Select GitHub Actions as the build and deployment source.
4. Push to `main`.

## Import and Export

The Data page supports:

- JSON bundle export
- JSON bundle import into local browser state
- record-specific draft export
- local preview before export

The Daily Activity and Calendar pages include assistant/admin local entry forms. Export the JSON bundle after local entry, then commit the updated JSON files.

Exports are useful for preparing Git commits. Imports are useful for review, testing, or restoring a local browser state.

## Print Support

Candidate summaries, meetings, and project/workbench detail panels are print-friendly. Use the Print buttons or browser print dialog to save PDFs.

## Future Backend Upgrade Path

The static data model already includes:

- role names
- visibility metadata
- timestamps
- created_by and updated_by
- append-only notes
- revision_history arrays

A later backend can map these fields to:

- Node.js + Express APIs
- real password login
- secure cookie sessions
- database persistence
- server-side authorization
- user management

Do not treat the static role picker as security. True authentication and authorization require a backend or a protected hosting layer.
